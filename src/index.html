  <h3>Do you want to know me?</h3>
    <p>I am Michelle van Wijk, 26 years old. Since two years I live in Amersfoort with my boyfriend Ruben. </br>
      In November last year we bought two kittens: Boef & Binkie. This two little men are very sweet. </br>
      During the day, I am working at O2 Communications. A very nice communication advice office in Maarssen. </br>
      In my function as 'Account Executive' I coordinate some project from one of the biggest clients: SalzburgerLand. </br>
      Because I always want to learn more and I always was interested in programming, I want to learn HTML and CSS.

  <h3>Do you want to what my skills are?</h3>

  <p>During the two studies I graduated I learned how to write HTML and CSS to create easy websites for many projects a did.</br>
    I liked to do that, so also in my leisure I created various websites to practice HTML and CSS. </br>
    It is a long time ago I created my last website, so time to retrieve this information.
